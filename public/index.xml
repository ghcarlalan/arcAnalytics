      <description>Since adding a Master’s degree diploma to my wall, I’ve moved on to a job that really doesn’t have anything to do with what I studied. Out of the team I’m currently a part of, almost everyone else has formal experience/knowledge/degrees in statistics, math, psychology, etc. As such, some people ask me what I studied (BBA Finance/Management &amp;amp; MS Finance) and what those degrees entailed. And while it’s only been a few months since I traded in my classes for meetings, I really can’t remember the overall picture – only specific projects or presentations.</description>

      <description>It’s been 5 years since I graduated high school. There were about 1,200 students in total when I left, and I graduated with 285 other young adults eager to do something with their lives. If Facebook is any indicator though, that something was to get married and/or have kids as soon as possible. It’s eastern Idaho; what can you expect?
So many Mormons is what you can expectThis can slightly (read: really) bum you out if you think you’re in the minority of not being one of those people who have found their life partner or have had their mini me before 23.</description>
