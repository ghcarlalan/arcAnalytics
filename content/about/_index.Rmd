I’m great at three things: making drinks, making jokes, and making graphs. This site is for my jokes.

Growing up on a small, isolated, Idahoan farm is a challenge. A challenge I’ve never had to face, thankfully. And while I did grow up in Idaho, I have no more knowledge of potatoes than the next person (FYI it's not even called the 'Potato State', it's called the 'Gem State' due to the abundance of rare jewel deposits across the state). I’ve been a few places, gotten a few degrees, and had a few experiences worth converting into visually appealing graphs. 

In general, I’m just a guy who’s trying to get by like anyone else. Currently, I’m living in Salt Lake City getting paid to make <i>even more graphs</i> as a Senior Business Intelligence Analyst. I also spend my spare time making cocktails to add a level of regality to my Saturday nights. In addition to that, I have a short list of “five minute fame” moments that I take more pride in than my Master’s degree:

* A <b>[Business Insider list](http://www.businessinsider.com/lulu-funniest-guys-in-every-state-2015-5)</b> for being the funniest guy in Idaho
* <b>[This Tweet](https://twitter.com/LikeAlwaysWrong/status/738046830143930368)</b> featured on The Chive, Facebook meme pages, and multiple group chats
* <b>[Highest rated post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wholesomememes/comments/8sicso/you_can_picture_their_smiles/)</b> on Reddit on July 20, 2018

I started this site as a project to visualize thoughts I have about who I am, what I do, and what anyone else does. If anything, it’s more of a live journal with actual interactive graphics instead of doodles. Either way, I try to put a humorous spin on the overall outlook of whatever is going on. If you want more snippets of my hilarity but with less graphs, [follow me on twitter](http://twitter.com/LikeAlwaysWrong).
